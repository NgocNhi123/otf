# OpenType Feature Showcase — [otf.thien.do](https://otf.thien.do)

I recently discovered [OpenType Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType#Advanced_typography) and quickly impressed by the enormous potential they could bring to web typography. However, the current state of their usage on the web is still quite limited. Many don't know about them, even those who would have benefit from.

Therefore, I decided to build **[otf](https://otf.thien.do)** as an interactive showcase of these typographic features. I hope it could help others explore OpenType Features easily so we can achieve better typography on the web.

Cheer!
